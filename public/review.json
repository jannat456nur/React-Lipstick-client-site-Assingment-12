Kismet is a boutique cosmetics brand that is based out of Louisiana and was created by a local makeup artist in the area."

        "description": "I tried three of the semi-matte lipsticks from their Velvet Collection: Crushed Coral (a mix of pink and orange tones), Burnout (a classic red) and Vivianna (a rich plum). I also tried out their new Succulent Collection that just recently became available. The Succulent Collection is Kismet's 2015 Fall/Winter collection of liquid lipsticks. The collection has four shades: Elope (a nude), Flamingo (a vibrant pink statement color), Speakeasy (a classic red) and On Point (a pink with orchid and nude undertones)."

        "description": "The name of this lipstick describes it perfectly. It is an orangey color that is very popular right now. Crushed Coral is a perfect blend between orange and pink that looks amazing in the summer months. I think this lipstick would complement any boho chic look perfectly!"
